# Boten ODK Repo
Repository containing the BotenODK solution for implementing object recognition on camera livefeeds

Processes camera livefeeds to a REST API which temporary stores the frames. The object recognition kit analyses the frames for boats and stores the required data.
Contains a dashboard front-end application which visualises the analysed data to the end users.
